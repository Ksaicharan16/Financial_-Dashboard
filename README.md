# Financial_-Dashboard
Understanding individual financial behavior is critical for financial institutions and policymakers. The project aimed to analyze investment patterns, gender-based financial decisions, and savings objectives to identify key trends and support strategic decision-making.

Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize and analyze investment preferences, financial behavior across age groups, gender-based investment trends, and savings objectives. The goal was to generate actionable insights that could guide financial decision-making and investment strategies.

Data Modeling & Transformation: Utilized MySQL for data extraction and transformation, creating structured datasets for analysis.
Dashboard Development: Designed and implemented interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize key investment trends, including:
Investment preferences by age, gender, and savings objectives.
Average investor age distribution by financial goals.
Source of investment advice (e.g., financial consultants, newspapers, online sources).
Monitoring frequency and duration of investments.
Advanced Analytics:
Created DAX measures for gender-based investment segmentation (Male vs. Female).
